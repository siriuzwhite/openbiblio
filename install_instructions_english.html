<h1>Release Notes:</h1>
</a>
<p>Version 0.7.1 is recommended for new installs and for updating older versions of OpenBiblio,
including all versions from <i>openbiblio.de</i>. The most important changes are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Updated to be compatible with MySQL 5.5.</li>
  <li>Updated for PHP 5.3.x deprecated features.</li>
  <li>Updated for PHP 5.4.0 backward incompatible changes.</li>
  <li>Fixes for bugs in OpenBiblio features.</li>
  <li>New and changed features: Check In shows hyperlinked member name (with Days Late and 
    outstanding Account Balance), Override Due Date, Renew All, Offline Circulation, Bibliography Checkout History, Custom Copy Fields, Copy Barcode Number validation less restrictive and optional, new search types Call Number and Keyword, OPAC search and view exclude nonpublic fields, new parameters for reports Copy Search and Popular Bibliographies, new reports, new layouts for media labels and  member cards.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> for more details. Please understand that 0.7.0 never was released officially, but we are still trying to following the version numbering convention expressed at the release of 0.6.0. Some changes for 0.7.1 might appear as new features (not in 0.7.0), technically they are built on bugfixes.</p>
Update urgency:
<ul>
  <li>Versions below 0.5.2: urgent. The deviant versions from <i>openbiblio.de</i> can now be 
    updated <a href="#update">automatically</a>.</li>
  <li>0.5.2: urgency depends on required compatibility, bugfixes, new features and on trusting 
    staff users with the reports privilege.</li>
  <li>0.6.0, 0.6.1: urgency depends on required compatibility, bugfixes and new features.</li>
  <li>0.7.0: many fixes for new features, especially in Circulation.</li>
</ul>
Known limitations:
<ul>
  <li>MARC is not stored perfectly in the database tables (issue 1, fixed in obiblio-10-wip).</li>
  <li>UTF-8 multibyte characters: very limited support in reports and possibly issues with search (issue 19).</li>
  <li>If you have not updated to 64 bit PHP before some day in the year 2038: days late and late fee not calculated, incorrect timestamp calculations for holds (issue 51).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<div class="notice">Steps 1-8: detail is out of date, but the basics are still valid.</div>
<ol>
  <li>To use your system for OpenBiblio you have to install a webserver, PHP and MySQL. If you didn't done it already, i recommend to use <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">XAMPP</a> for this installation, because this includes all the needed programs in one installation (of course except Openbiblio). XAMPP is ditributed for <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html">Windows</a>, <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html">Linux</a>, <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-macosx.html">MacOS X</a> and <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-solaris.html">Solaris</a>. The Windows-Version doesn't run with Windows ME, because there are problems with Apache2 (there are TCP/IP-Problems under Win ME). If you use Win ME or a other not mentioned system, please use the manual installation (since point 4), otherwise continue with point 2. (i want to thank Christopher Dagleish for the hint to XAMPP :-))</li>
  <li>Download <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">XAMPP</a> in the version, which your system needs, the Lite-version is sufficient but i recommend the full version nevertheless (this version offers regulary updates...). Following install the downloaded XAMPP (the installation is described on the site of the corresponding XAMPP-version in english, so i didn't explain it here, but please read everything there :-)). Now you should start XAMPP (it's explained there how) and you have a running Apache, PHP and MySQL. Continue now with the installation of OpenBiblio at point 7.!</li>
  <li>The following points 4-6 you only have to do, if you didn't installed XAMPP (or XAMPP doesn't run):</li>
  <li>Install a web server such as <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> that is compatible with PHP.  If you install Apache, get familiar with starting and stopping your Apache Web Server. If you are running Windows 95 or Windows 98 there will be "Start Apache" and "Stop Apache" icons that will help you start and stop your web server. You may want to consider adding the "Start Apache" icon to your startup folder. If you are running NT or Windows 2000 you can add Apache as a service which will be running, even if you are logged off.  If you are running Linux your Apache server should be packaged with your Linux installation and will start when you start Linux. <b>Attention: Under Windows ME there are much reports about problems with Apache 2.0.x (in my practice it doesn't run, as long as i had installed networkcards, the tcp/ip-driver of ME seems buggy), take Apache 1.3.33 in this case.</b>
  </li>
  <li>Add PHP to your web server as a CGI or a module.  If you are using Apache 2.0, I would highly recommend that you install PHP as a module instead of a cgi application.  In my experience the Apache PHP module performed over 4 times faster than the cgi PHP.  See <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.apache2.php">Example 3-9. PHP and Apache 2.0 as Module</a> in the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/">PHP Manual</a> for more info on how to install PHP as a module.
     <p>OpenBiblio uses session data.  Therefore, you will need to make sure PHP sessions are turned on. Be sure to create a directory for your session data on your server and specify the session.save_path in your php.ini file.  The default php.ini sets session.save_path to "/tmp".  Therefore, you have to create a directory called c:/tmp (for Windows) users.  However, I usually create a more descriptive name inside my PHP directory and then change my php.ini file to match it.
     <p>Example php.ini directive:
     <pre>session.save_path = d:\PHP\sessiondata</pre>
     
     <p>See section <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.session.php">XCIII. Session handling functions</a> in the PHP manual for more details on PHP sessions.
  </li>
  <li>Install the MySQL database from <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</a>. Get familiar with starting and stopping your MySQL Server.  See <a href="http://www.mysql.com/doc/W/i/Win95_start.html">Starting MySQL on Windows 95 or Windows 98</a> for more information.<br><br>If you are running NT or Windows 2000, setup MySQL as a service so it starts whenever the machine powers up.  See <a href="http://www.mysql.com/doc/N/T/NT_start.html">Starting MySQL on Windows NT or Windows 2000</a> for more information on starting MySQL as a service.<br><br>
     If you are running Linux, MySQL should be packaged with your Linux installation and will start when you start Linux.
  </li>
  <li>The following points are describing the installation of OpenBiblio and have to be done from everything, who install OpenBiblio at the first time (never mind if you use XAMPP or installed apache, PHP and MySQL on a other way):</li>
  <li>Get familiar with logging into MySQL with your admin account within a DOS prompt window.  You can use the following command sequence as a test.
<blockquote><pre>
C:\><b>c:\mysql\bin\mysql -uroot mysql</b>
Enter password: <b>*********</b>
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 8 to server version: 3.23.26-beta

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer

C:\>
</pre></blockquote>
  </li>     


  <a name="step9">
  <li>Create an OpenBiblio database.  To do this, log into MySQL with your admin account 
     and run the following SQL command.
     <blockquote><pre>
mysql> <b>create database OpenBiblio /*!40100 default character set latin1 */;</b>
</pre>
<div class="new">
<strong>New:</strong> The conditional comment <b><tt>/* ... */ </tt></b>is executed on MySQL 4.1.0 or higher and specifies <tt>latin1</tt> as the default database character set for the database created.
</div>
<br>
<div class="notice">
You might discover issues when the database character set is not  <tt>latin1</tt>.
<table border="1">
<th>database&nbsp;character&nbsp;set</th>
<th>tab Admin: Library Settings, field <i>HTML&nbsp;Charset</i></th>
<th>comment</th>

<td>latin1<br><i>(recommended)</i></td>
<td>iso-8859-1<br><i>(initial value, set by install)</i></td>
<td>No issues.</i></td>

</table></div>
<br>
<div class="new">
<strong>New:</strong> When OpenBiblio HTML Charset setting is UTF-8, PDF layouts can display some multibyte characters correctly by converting to single byte.
</div>
<br>
     To check to make sure the OpenBiblio database was created properly, run the following command.
<pre>
mysql> <b>show databases;</b>
+--------------+
| Database     |
+--------------+
| mysql        |
| OpenBiblio   |
+--------------+
</pre></blockquote>

  </li>
  </a>

  <a name="step10">
  <li>Create an OpenBiblio database user.  To do this, login to MySQL under the admin userid
    and run the following SQL command, substituting <i>obiblio_user</i> and <i>obiblio_password</i> with the userid and password of your choice.
<blockquote><table><tr>
<td><pre>mysql> 
    -> </pre></td>
<td><pre><b>grant all privileges on OpenBiblio.* to <i>obiblio_user</i>@localhost</b></b>
<b>identified by '<i>obiblio_password</i>';</pre></td>
</tr></table></blockquote>
  </li>
  </a>

  <li>Verify your OpenBiblio database and user by logging into the new MySQL database under the new user.
<blockquote><pre>
<b>C:\mysql\bin\mysql -u<i>obiblio_user</i> -p<i>obiblio_password</i> OpenBiblio</b>
</pre></blockquote>
  </li>

  <a name="step11">
  <li>Copy the openbiblio directory and all of its contents into your web server's htdocs
    root or any subdirectory within the htdocs root.
  </li></a>
  <a name="step12">
  <li>Edit the database_constants.php file (located in the main openbiblio directory)
    with the text editor of your choice.
    Change the username and password to match the new MySQL user and password that you 
    created in the previous steps.
  </li></a>
  <li>Create the OpenBiblio database tables.  To do this run the install php script
   located at <a href="http://localhost/openbiblio/install/index.php">http://localhost/openbiblio/install/index.php</a>, assuming you placed the openbiblio directory in the root htdocs directory.
  </li>
  <li><strong>For security:</strong> Remove the openbiblio/install directory completely
    to prevent unauthorized use of install or upgrade tools.</li>
  <li><strong>For security:</strong> Verify that the <tt>display_errors</tt> setting in php.ini is 'Off' to prevent unintended information disclosure.</li>
  <li>Access your new library automation system at <a href="http://localhost/openbiblio/index.php">http://localhost/openbiblio/index.php</a>, assuming you placed the openbiblio directory in the root htdocs directory.  Enter "admin" for both the userid and password whenever you are prompted to signon.  You can change the admin password from the "Admin" tab -> staff list, where you can also add more library staff members.
  </li>
</ol>


<br>
<a name="update">
<h1>Updating from a previous version of OpenBiblio:</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Rename your old openbiblio installation directory so that you don't lose its contents.  We'll call the old directory openbiblio-old.
  </li>
  <li>Copy the new openbiblio directory and all of its contents into the directory where the old openbiblio installation was.
  </li>
  <li>Copy the database_constants.php file from the openbiblio-old directory into the new openbiblio directory, replacing the database_constants.php file there.
  </li>
  <li>Backup your database.  See your MySQL documentation for instructions. (use mysqldump)
  </li>
  <li>Update your OpenBiblio database tables by using the conversion tool located at <a href="http://localhost/openbiblio/install/index.php">http://localhost/openbiblio/install/index.php</a>, assuming you placed the openbiblio directory in the root htdocs directory.
  </li>
  <li><strong>For security:</strong> Remove the openbiblio/install directory completely
    to prevent unauthorized use of install or upgrade tools.</li>
  <li><strong>For security:</strong> Verify that the <tt>display_errors</tt> setting in php.ini is 'Off' to prevent unintended information disclosure.</li>
</ol>
<div class="notice">
<strong>Updates from 0.7.0:</strong> 0.7.1 is a bugfix release to 0.7.0: it can run without 
upgrading the database. However, step 5 is recommended. This cleans unused entries from the 
database and lifts some restrictions.
